      <p><p>I saw a post recently about the likelihood of a baseball team winning based on how many runs, hits, and other baseball statistics. I liked the idea and thought of applying that to college football. Particularly, I'm interested in knowing whether scoring more points or having a stout defense improves the likelihood of becoming bowl eligible.</p>

      <p><p>I often see graphs that are poorly implemented in that they do not achieve their goal.  One such type of graph that I see are dodged bar charts.  Here is an example of a dodged bar chart summarizing the number of all star players by team (focusing specifically on the AL central division) and year from the <em>Lahman</em> r package:</p>

Since the semester has wrapped up, below are my thoughts on how the course went with respect to the students using R.</p>

      <p><p>Recently while scraping some data from the college football data warehouse site, I started to realize the evolution of my code.  To preface this, I am definitely not a trained programmer, just a self taught junky who enjoys doing it when I have time.  I've slowly evolved my programming skills from simply statistics languages like r or SPSS, to some other languages like LaTeX, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and I've started to work through some python.</p>

      <p><p>I've added a new functionality to my <em>highlightHTML</em> package.  This package post-processes HTML files and injects CSS and adds tags to create some further customization (for example highlight cells of a HTML table).  This is most useful when writing a document using markdown and converting it into a HTML document using a tool like knitr, slidify, or even pandoc.</p>

      <p><p>My last post I talked about using <em>rCharts</em> to create interactive graphics for my interview presentations.  They seemed to go over pretty well in my interviews and helped me greatly as I did not need to remember or write down specific numbers to talk about.

      <p><p>I have a few upcoming presentations as a part of job interviews. To prepare for these interviews, I'm attempting to make my figures a bit more interactive within my presentations.  The aim is to be able to limit any large cumbersome tables I would need to include in my presentations and replace them with interactive plots that can look up values, zoom in, etc.</p>

      <p><p>Recently I decided to switch statistical programs used introductory statistics course for masters students that I teach at the University of Arkansas.  Historically this course has been taught with SPSS, but I am attempting the switch to R this semester.  Most students in this class have never used a statistical program before and have no programming background/interest.  As a result, I did not want to have them learn statistics and the R language in the same semester and have them using R with a gui interface.  The two primary gui systems/packages I explored were the <em>Deducer</em> package and the <em>Rcmdr</em> package.  Here are my initial thoughts on the switch.</p>

      <p><p>My last post I talked about how I use the <em>data.table</em> package for aggregating and removing duplicate observations.  Although I use the <em>data.table</em> package quite often, there are many times when I use <em>plyr</em> (and now the new <em>dplyr</em>) package, primarily because of its easy, intuitive syntax.</p>

      <p><p>When I started to use the <em>data.table</em> package I was primarily using it to aggregate.  I had read about <em>data.table</em> and its blazing speed compared to the other options from base or the <em>plyr</em> package especially with large amounts of data.  As an example, I remember calculating averages or percentages while at Saint Paul Public Schools and while the calculations were running would walk away for 5 minutes to wait for them to finish.  When using <em>data.table</em> to do the same calculations I didn't need to wait 5 minutes to see the calculated values.</p>

      <p><p>My first statistical software package I used as an undergrad was SPSS.  I was fortunate during my senior year at <a href="http://www.luther.edu">Luther College</a> to be initially introduced to <a href="http://r-project.org">R</a>.  I did not realize it at the time (except for the pretty graphics) that this was the start of something big for me.  Fast forward a year to graduate school at the University of Minnesota and the majority of my program was again using SPSS.  Under the tutelage of <a href="http://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/Faculty/Zieffler.html">Andy</a> in my first graduate statistics course I started to do analyses in both R and SPSS.  After that I started to do all my analyses in R.  Fast forward five years this time to my first full-time job after graduate school at <a href="http://www.spps.org">Saint Paul Public Schools</a> and again everyone was using SPSS.  Fortunately in my year there I was able to significantly push them toward using R more and more.</p>

      <p><p>This past summer when the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/twincitiesrug/">twin cities R user group</a> was starting to get back up and running, I offered to present on some R related things that I was working on.  One thing I was working on was a part of my last <a href="http://http://educate-r.org/2013/09/28/ConditionalFormat/">post</a>.  In a response to discussing this during a meeting, I was posed with the problem of how to do this with a markdown table.  I replied I was unsure how to do this directly with R, but it could likely be possible.</p>

      <p><p>One thing that I had the opportunity to develop while working last year at <a href="http://spps.org/">Saint Paul Public Schools</a> was figuring out a quick, easy, and painless way to do interactive report generation.  When I arrived in the REA department at Saint Paul Public Schools, the report generation process was roughly as follows:<br/>
1. Do the analysis in SPSS (compute percent proficient for standard tests by various subgroups).<br/>
2. Format output and copy output into Excel.<br/>
3. Once in Excel, do lookup tables to generate the report in Excel.</p>

      <p><p>Welcome to my new website/blog.  I am aiming to highlight some of the R packages that I have created.  You can see a list of all the R packages I have in development and also see the source code on github here: <a href="http://educate-r.org/projects.html">R packages</a>.  In addition, I'll likely talk about various topics with statistics, teaching, research, or R in general.</p>
